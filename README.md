# Alcohol_detection_by_facial_expression

Implementation:

•
The ML model utilized a dataset of 15,000 samples, divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets.

•
Preprocessing steps included Z-score normalization and removal of redundant data points.

•
The supervised SNN was trained using a backpropagation algorithm with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

•
The system was integrated with a cloud server for data logging and analysis, ensuring scalability and remote monitoring capabilities


At this point of automation development, the main focus is eliminating human involvement entirely. This is where things get straightforward because self-driving vehicles can easily be used for personal travel, public transport, or heavy freight. Not only that, but the fact that it can also be integrated anywhere due to an easily expandable design, indicates that it would be a solid fix to ADAS drive assisted accidents. And I have to add because they integrate well with many advanced international programs about making transport more intelligent and more secure.
